## Overview

Led the design and deployment of John Deere's enterprise-scale Aftermarket Recommendations system as a Data Engineer in the Data Aftermarket & Customer Sales (DA&CS) division. This project involved architecting machine-specific recommendation pipelines that process over 500,000 machine records across US/Canadian and global markets, directly contributing to over $52M in revenue generation across precision agriculture, warranty, and aftermarket business segments.

## Key Achievements

- **Machine Learning Pipeline Architecture**: Architected PySpark-based recommendation engines processing **500K+ machine records** across US/CA and global markets, implementing advanced feature engineering and model deployment pipelines for scalable eCommerce integration
- **Predictive Analytics for Equipment Lifecycle**: Engineered machine learning models for PowerGard and JDProtect eligibility prediction, applying statistical analysis and clustering algorithms to categorize **654K machines** by lifecycle patterns, enabling predictive maintenance recommendations that drove **$107K in dealer reimbursements**
- **Advanced Analytics Leadership**: Developed sophisticated data science solutions and mentored enterprise teams on advanced Power BI techniques, leading cross-functional analytics initiatives and resolving complex statistical modeling challenges
- **Revenue Optimization Models**: Delivered predictive analytics and recommendation systems contributing **$52M+ in revenue** across precision agriculture, warranty, and aftermarket segments through data-driven machine learning approaches

## Technical Implementation

- **Data Processing**: PySpark-based distributed computing framework for large-scale machine record analysis and filtering
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Enterprise-grade data pipelines aligned with John Deere coding standards and best practices
- **System Integration**: Seamless integration with eCommerce platforms and Point of Sale (PoPS) systems for recommendation delivery
- **Machine Categorization**: Advanced lifecycle analytics using age and usage metrics for targeted maintenance and warranty recommendations
- **Global Scalability**: Multi-region pipeline deployment supporting both domestic and international markets

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: Large-scale distributed data processing for machine record analysis and filtering
- **Databricks**: Cloud-based analytics platform for pipeline deployment and optimization
- **Power BI**: Advanced analytics dashboards and enterprise reporting solutions
- **SQL**: Complex queries for machine categorization and eligibility determination
- **Enterprise Data Systems**: Integration with eCommerce and PoPS platforms for recommendation delivery

## Challenges and Solutions

The primary challenge was designing a system that could handle the complexity of machine-specific recommendations while maintaining scalability across global markets. Different regions had varying business rules, machine types, and aftermarket needs that required flexible pipeline architecture. The solution involved:

- **Flexible Pipeline Design**: Created modular pipeline architecture that could adapt to different regional business rules
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented advanced data processing techniques to handle 500K+ records efficiently
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Worked closely with Lifecycle Services to understand machine age and usage patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Established enterprise coding standards alignment for long-term maintainability

## Business Impact

- **Revenue Generation**: Contributed over $52M in revenue across precision, warranty, and aftermarket segments
- **Dealer Support**: Enabled $107K in targeted dealer reimbursements through precise maintenance recommendations
- **Enterprise Recognition**: Earned Power BI "Power-User" status with badges of thanks for supporting enterprise-wide reporting
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Delivered production-ready pipelines supporting both US/CA and global markets
- **Cross-Segment Impact**: Successfully served precision agriculture, warranty, and aftermarket business segments
