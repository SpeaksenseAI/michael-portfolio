## Overview

Applied design thinking methodologies to solve complex user interaction challenges at Pekin Insurance, creating a more intuitive and streamlined interface that significantly improved the user onboarding experience and overall platform usability.

## Key Features

- **Streamlined User Interface**: Redesigned complex insurance workflows into intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that reduced cognitive load and improved task completion rates.
- **Design Thinking Implementation**: Applied systematic design thinking methodologies to identify and solve complex user interaction challenges.
- **Comprehensive Usability Testing**: Conducted extensive usability testing with both internal stakeholders and end-users to validate design solutions and gather actionable feedback.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Worked closely with developers and project managers to ensure seamless implementation of design elements.

## Technologies Used

- **Design Thinking Methodologies**: Systematic approach to problem-solving and user experience optimization.
- **Usability Testing Tools**: Comprehensive testing frameworks for gathering user feedback and measuring satisfaction.
- **Collaborative Design Process**: Cross-functional team coordination for effective design implementation.
- **Interface Design Tools**: Professional design software for creating intuitive user interfaces.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was simplifying complex insurance processes while maintaining all necessary functionality and compliance requirements. Insurance workflows are inherently complex, but users needed a more intuitive way to navigate these processes. Through iterative design and continuous user feedback, we were able to create solutions that maintained functional completeness while dramatically improving usability.

## Outcome

- **Improved Onboarding Efficiency**: Reduced user onboarding time by 30% through streamlined interface design
